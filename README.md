# MotifGenie
MotifGenie is a Python command line tool for searching transcription factor binding motif sequences in merged ChIP-Seq binding sites. First, MotifGenie analyzes multiple ChIP-Seq samples simultaneously to identify shard binding regions for a locus of interest, then, searches the binding motif sequence of a given transcription factor in these shared binding regions.
